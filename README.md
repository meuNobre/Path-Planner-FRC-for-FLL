# Path Planner FRC for FLL

This project adapts the Path Planner used in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) for the FIRST LEGO League (FLL), enabling precise trajectory planning for SPIKE Prime robots even without physical visibility of the competition field.

## 🚀 Project Goal

To create accurate trajectories for FLL robots, making mission programming and execution more efficient and manageable, especially in remote or simulated environments.

## 📦 Technologies Used

- **Next.js**
- **React**
- **Vercel** (for deployment)

## 🌐 Access the Application

You can access the online version of the application here:

👉 [path-planner-frc-for-fll.vercel.app](https://path-planner-frc-for-fll.vercel.app)

## 🛠️ Features

- Visual creation of trajectories for SPIKE Prime robots.
- Automatic generation of Python code to control the robot.
- Visualization of the planned trajectories.
- Export the generated code for competition use.
